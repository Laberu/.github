## 📖 How It Works
1. Users input a set of images of infrastructure.
2. The system processes the images to generate a 3D model using photogrammetric techniques.
3. AI-driven algorithms analyze the 3D model to detect structural damage at the pixel level.
4. The model undergoes a processing period of approximately one week for thorough analysis.
5. Once processing is complete, the results are displayed on the website for users to review.
6. Users can interact with the 3D model, apply texture and lighting adjustments, and export it in multiple formats.
